Found a copyright free data set to use as sample with our program. Modified the data (removed irrelevant fields and added director field from cast) to better suit our program. Created a script to generate reviews. Added some basic search functions.

Week 5
Added an accounts table to the database and added database functions to interact with the table.

Week 7
Created a movie class. Added a image column to the movies table in the database. Also wrote a script to download movie posters and add the path to the images to the database.

Week 8
Made the review class. Added functions relating to review/wishlist/banlist to the appropriate classes. Implemented rating based on banlist. Added extra fields to movie class and added these to the database. Made some fields auto update on insertion/deletion of reviews.

Week 9
Implemented recommendation functions. Refactored classes/controller/routes. Made the movie page and ratings reflect contents of the banlist. Changed how ratings are calculated so that a movie with a single 5 star review was not shown first. Refactored class files, controller and routes. Various bug fixes. Worked on adding similar movies to the moviepage with roger.
